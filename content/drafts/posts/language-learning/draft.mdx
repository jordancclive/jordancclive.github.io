Most people's thoughts, beliefs, and tastes are purely a reflection of the time and geography of their lives. Without deliberate personal effort, people think and speak within the flow of their cultural currents. No matter how hard we try to think otherwise, we all know that stereotypes are based on *some* truth. Data makes it irrefutable. However, we all know people who do not represent the stereotypes of their demographics. We *do* have it in us to become something of our own design.

## What Foreign Language Learning Does For Cognition

Every language has cultural elements infused throughout. The cognitive benefit of learning a foreign language is it enables you to rethink the foundations of your cultural programming. This is not about just trying to be different to make yourself unique. Learning a foreign language for its cognitive benefits is about exploring new channels of reality.

Cross-cultural experiences obviously accelerate international understanding, but also personal discovery. The reason people often look back on their gap year abroad or their international studies as a highlight of their formative adult years is because, counterintuitively, of how much they learned about themselves. Being faced with new ideas and ways of life provides the perfect contrast upon which to evaluate the merit of one's own thoughts and ways of life. Foreign experiences teach you about yourself - what you think and what you believe.

We assume more than we realize about what is "common sense" or what is "normal."

## Breaking Down "Normal" Thinking and Behavior Across the World

To illustrate the vastly different cultural elements surrounding foreign languages, below are culture maps based on extensive data compiled from independent researchers who have studied the way people work within companies from the major economies of every continent. They are elaborated on in great detail in the book, <a href="https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/" target="default">The Culture Map</a>. The book does not go into the roots of these cultural realities, though. *The Culture Map* just gives abundant evidence that these culture differences create vastly different work environments internationally and then provides techniques for driving results among foreign teams.

### Trust

Different cultures calibrate trust between their head and their heart differently. Americans have the most task-based system of trust in the world. A business trip with coworkers will likely be almost all business with a bit of relaxation. Close working engagements in Anglo, Scandinavian, and some Western European countries will be relatively more transactional. Where trust is built based on task execution, business and personal lives are much more clearly divided.

I know from experience that business trips with Chinese, Nepali, or Latin Americans are much more about building relationships. Where trust is built on relationships, working hours will encompass more than a cut-and-dry 40 hour work week. It will include meals, parties, and other types of outings outside of the 9-5. The personal and professional lives are much more blended.

I've noticed over the years that the Chinese men I hit it off with are much more likely to be approaching me about working together. For almost all of these instances I felt uncomfortable about them, and a tad betrayed. Why does it seem harder to have a genuine, untainted friendship without ulterior motives with Chinese men? I get approached about partnership roles that are so distant from what I do professionally, I wonder how they would think these were good ideas? It was only recently that I realized I had been looking at them the wrong way. They were signs that they just wanted to be around me more.

### Persuasion

Different areas of the world consider things from drastically different historical viewpoints. Generally, the older the culture, the more context will be needed surrounding a thesis or a proposal to be persuaded of it. The newer the culture, the more people will communicate the novelties and be willing to assume the details can be sorted out afterward.

In America we think micro to macro. We read addresses starting at the house number and ending with the state or country. We're expected to communicate our business ideas with an elevator pitch. We explore many more conversation topics within a sitting.

In East Asia, people are thinking macro to micro. Written addresses start with the country and end with the apartment number. People orient their thinking and their actions around philosophy with precedent measured in millennia. New ideas are more thoroughly evaluated by them. A single conversation topic could occupy a whole evening as the connections to seemingly distant ideas are explored. People will weave in and out of a wide variety of threads stemming from the core topic. It could take minutes before someone connects their stream of ideas to the core topic.

In the middle lie the western world and Latin America who feel a lot closer to Americans, in contrast to thought in East Asia, but they still have more of an appetite to know why. This is still very consequential for Americans to know. You need to have your stuff in order when proposing an idea or thesis to the rest of the western hemisphere.

### Communication

Different cultures leave varying amounts of their spoken communication to the context it was spoken in. To the British, a country in the middle ground, American humor is too detailed - almost giving away the punch lines. And the highest-context countries in East Asia look at way more surrounding any given interaction than do people in low-context cultures.

This has everything to do with how culturally diverse the given area of the world has historically been. People have been immigrating to the US for opportunity since its foundation. Here if you are not understood, it's your fault for not being clear enough. The US has the lowest-context communication. In Japan, the highest-context country, if someone doesn't understand then people are more likely to think of them as "someone who can't read the air." That makes sense because Japan has barely seen any immigration, historically, and the result has been that people there are very in tune with each other's meaning when they communicate. They have not needed to be so explicit as Americans have.

In American business schools they teach you to "tell them what you are going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you've told them." In China, where people are about as high-context as the Japanese, there are hundreds of four-character (and -syllable) summaries of ideas for all kinds of historical events over past millennia, and the less you have to say to communicate your ideas, the wiser you are understood to be. It's much more common for people to be around each other in silence.

### Leadership

The extent to which leaders throughout the world expect their own stances to steer the ship varies drastically.
