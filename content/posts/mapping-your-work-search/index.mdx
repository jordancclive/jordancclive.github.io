*Note: I deliberately do not use the terms 'job search' or 'work for'. It's not a mindset I personally agree with. I don't work because it's 'my job' - I do what I love to do, which is innovate. I don't work for people to get a pay check, I work **with** teams on problems I care about.*

At any given time I have ten or more design students that are all filling a skills gap in order to either level up or course correct their careers. While they are the ones who prompted me to publish this article, it's relevant to anyone on the search.

Everything here outlines how *I* have seen success in my searches thus far in my career. This is not meant to be *the* definitive guide to career development, but this methodology did recently allow me to choose between four prospective employers and land the best role I've ever had. (If you want to see what a happy company looks like, see <a href="/what-a-happy-company-looks-like-joining-open-zeppelin">my latest post</a> about it.)

## The System Surrounding Your Work Search

Lining up a new role requires repetitive work, and you can often miss the forest for the trees, so it can be helpful to take a step back and visualize the *system* of variables and moving pieces that you're navigating. The process requires you to influence the actions of others. Visualizing exactly what those actions are may help you fine tune your approach. If you are fortunate to have a sidekick of any kind involved in your search, these diagrams can synchronize your thoughts and add value to your discussions.

Here is the system surrounding your work search:

## Your Role in Your Search

That top swim lane in the map above is your role in all of this. It's the busiest lane.

<br />
<br />

This should be pretty representative of anyone's search. The key takeaways are that you must:
1. Tend to, expand, and leverage your network
2. Adapt to feedback
3. Be interesting and present yourself as such
4. Impress employers
5. Be able to negotiate

<br />

For each of these five points, there are things you can do for immediate results and things you can do that have a timeline less within your control. The pinnacle moments of your life will be based on compounded earnings based on habitual investments over long periods of time. Successful people (and "lucky people") typically do the things unsuccessful people aren't disciplined enough to do.

### Work Search Actions With Immediate Returns

The following items are listed intentionally in this order. They build on top of each other - ultimately putting you in front of the best employer options your network can produce and can make you look your best in your application processes.

- **Add everyone you have ever known on LinkedIn.** Elementary school contacts? Why not? Add them. Never understimate the possibilities. They know people. Loose acquaintances are surprisingly helpful. I don't fully know how to make sense of it, but they are.
- **Strategically reach out to people.** Who do you know that are in your target industry / company / team / role or know people that are? How might you best rekindle these contacts? Who at your dream companies are hiring people for your desired roles? What about these hiring managers can you relate with and stand out among the crowd with your LinkedIn message? (I highly recommend getting a LinkedIn premium account for your work search). What recruiters focus their recruitment efforts on your kind of role / your industy of interest / your desired company / etc? How might you present yourself as a great opportunity for these recruiters?
- **Ask people you know for referrals.** In the course of conversations with people, organically raise the question of who they know that might be able to help you achieve your current career goals. You never know who might have a highly-relevant contact to help you put your foot in the door of the right team.
- **Announce that you're seeking opportunities.** Do this in multiple ways. Marking your LinkedIn profile as 'Open to Work' - this puts you on recruiters' radars (which is how I scored my current role). Put 'Seeking Opportunities in ___' as your LinkedIn profile tagline and be active on LinkedIn - every comment you make will telegraph the message to people within and outside of your network. Make a post specifically about what you're looking for. How else could you expect people to know and keep an eye out for you?
- **Produce meaningful content** on LinkedIn, Twitter, or whatever other platform you're on that could feasibly attract attention from employers. When everyone knows you have begun a work search, you will see people message you about opportunities right after you make these posts, because they have reminded of you. Attracting relevant viewers to your content via the right groups, channels, subthreads, etc, will present opportunities to capture your audience, expand your network, and benefit from recurring rewards.
- **Apply to your desired openings.** This is generally the least fruitful strategy - especially when done on its own. However, producing an efficient application submission strategy can and does still work.

Here is the process in the form of a funnel:

<br />

  <div className="scroll">

<br />
<br />

Make sure you're adding as many relevant people at every level of the funnel in order to get yourself in front of the prospective employers you're trying to attract. Deliver on quality (personal bio, resume, portfolio, LinkedIn profile, online content, etc) to increase the percentage of people passing you along the line to hiring managers. Increase the spread of information about you on relevant channel to get leads. Ultimately, the better you perform, the better offers you will receive. Additionally, the more offers you receive, the more choice you will have.

<br />

### Adapting to Feedback

If personal growth is a high priority for you, then avoiding roles you're 100% prepared for will inevitably mean you have things to learn and adaptations to make from your findings. The economy is an ever-evolving job market - especially in tech. As a result, you will need to make ongoing refinements to your personal marketing and positioning to maintain your own product market fit. All of this activity will surface insights about you, your network, what strategies of yours produces fruit most naturally, what the gap is between where you are and where you want to be, etc. Insights will come in a variety of ways - the way people react (or do not react) to the things you say, react to the way you word ideas in your resume, or to the content in your personal website or portfolio.

In tech, where things evolve faster, industries adapt differently, and companies adapt on different timelines, personal positioning is even more nuanced. Pay attention to all forms of feedback that you receive and be judicious in how to take it into account for your personal strategy. The better you're about to detect these insights and react to them, the more efficient you will be setting your sights on the right things and achieving the best outcomes for the current stage you're in with your career.

...

Despite all of these items being the ones with most short-term returns, it is more important to focus on building your network. If you're fighting for survival right now, then maybe you'll have to focus on the above items out of urgency, but as soon as you have the breathing room, one of the best things you can do to never go through your current difficult state is to invest in your network.

<br />

### Attracting "Luck" Long-term (and Maybe Some in the Short-Term, Too)

**The results you earn building your network on this work search will benefit you on your future ones.** This is an area of compounding returns, so if you can afford to, focus on this more than anything else during your work search.

Most of what building a network entails has to do with your way of life. People with a strong network have worked for it very hard over an extensive period of time. To build your network you have to do things that expand it by being outside your comfort zone, and strengthen it by investing time and effort into deepening your connection with people individually.

Attend industry-relevant events. Talk to new people, be engaging, and add value wherever possible. Stay in touch with people online. Join online groups. Schedule lunches with people. Plan weekends with people. Help people out. If helping others out is not a way of life for you, you can't rightfully expect others to be helpful to you. If you want to earn people's long-term, recurring endorsement and support, help people without any expectation of something in return.

These efforts do not usually turn into huge life developments immediately. If you have not been an active networker or much of a help to people thus far in your life, start ASAP. Learn to enjoy it and make it habitual. Compounding benefits will follow over your years and decades ahead.
