description: Since September, 2020, I've continually worked on improving the quality of my off-hours design mentorship with my UX students. Given that this was never my top priority day to day, though, my improvements over time were only incremental.
---

In <a href="" >part 1</a> of this series I detailed out, among other things, that:
1. given the long, 12-16 month duration between a student starting the course and finding a job, it would be more actionable to optimize for # of mentorship calls instead of hiring outcomes of my students
2. I saw significant improvements from multiple optimizations made to my process
3. to increase the number of mentorship call bookings, messaging my students would be more influential than improving the quality of my mentorship calls
4. I was not messaging my students and needed to put in place a system for that

## Fruits of my Call Recommendations and Other Process Improvements

Within a couple months of distributing the call recommendations list, I saw the best work of my students up to this point in my mentorship.

#### CareerFoundry Students of Other Mentors Are Requesting They Be Reassigned to Me

Within only a couple weeks of publishing <a href="" >part 1</a> of this series, CareerFoundry notified me of a couple students that were already in the middle of their courses and requested they be reassigned to me as their mentor. They had independently heard good things about my mentorship from other students. That brought me to my cap of desired students and I don't know about any other students that may have made the same request.

## Results from Messaging My Students

Starting on August 23rd, I began a weekly routine of messaging my students who don't currently have a scheduled call on the calendar. They usually go something like this: "Great job completing the [number] exercise. Let's get a time on the calendar for our [next incomplete call type]! (Or any other call option you want to cover, instead...)"

The last two weeks of August had the highest average number of calls per student of any two-week period up to this point. Despite being away on vacation for the first two weeks of August, the month brought in higher revenues than July.


- Ave. # of calls per *active* student per month
    - An enrolled student who has either completed an achievement within the last two months or had a call with me within the previous one month
- No. of inactive students per month â†’ I'm accumulating them
    - Behavioral modification
        - Read Nudge, etc.

# Process Improvements to Make to My Mentorship Before Sept. Monthend

- Make one of the days of the week my day to design a personal project and all mentoring hours are shadowing sessions for that day.
- Provide common Q&As and tips to students for ramping up to speed immediately.
    - How can I get hired asap?
    - Figma for Hifi design, prototyping (and even possibly flow charts)
        - Figma Ninja
    - Whimsical for flows and wireframes
- If the beginning of the student's course really is the most consequential period to get them active, then I need to have a self-introduction video on my profile

Being more thorough w/ CF student data will impress clients

[Go deeper into CF data and improve spreadsheet](https://www.notion.so/Go-deeper-into-CF-data-and-improve-spreadsheet-8cfddd01fd644c2384f5e1a3e9712568)

Improvements to be made with the CF spreadsheet:

- Improve the dashboard - split into two sheets
- Delete old spreadsheet after:
    - Pulling booking / scheduling data
    - ?
- Get data from grads and incorporate it
- Review my old comments and ensure nothing has fallen through the cracks
- Improve titles / labels throughout
- Control data for substitute students
- Average time to complete each achievement
- Put my desired dashboard in front
- Set up my desired dashboard
