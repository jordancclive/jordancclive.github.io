There are innumerable tools UX Designers pull out for various scenarios, and you can tell who's an expert by their continuous ability to pull out the right one for the job. If there's one I have not been able to do without thus far with my product design experience, it's user personas. There are multiple reasons for this:
1. **They align team efforts.** Even if my team feels like we understand who we're designing for, we never know for sure that we're working in sync until we have the visible documentation in front of us.
2. **They eliminate suboptimal or wasteful work.** I have never gone through the creation process of user personas - or even prototype personas - where the team did not make indispensable realizations about our end customers. In every instance, priorities were corrected, months of expensive work going the wrong direction was avoided, or critical strategic insights were surfaced for product development.
3. **They inspire meaningful subtleties that produce deep user engagement.** I feel connected with the personas for whom I design products and messaging. If I am to continue thinking about them "after hours," that is important. It's the details in the persona documentation - even if they're just best guesses from stake holders - that enable me to design interactions and information with precision.
4. **Personas reduce mental overhead during the design process.** Without useful documentation like user personas, I just have too much mental overhead during the design process. Documentation is needed to ensure I'm on course and avoid important items from falling through the cracks as time passes and complexities occupy my mental resources.

Below are representative personas of the actual people for whom my entire team and I facilitated user interviews. Each of them accurately represent multiple customers we spoke with. (I'm not satisfied with the photos, which would ideally be larger with higher resolution, but they get the job done.) These are the kind of people who buy personal servers.

- hopes Daplie can have time-specific sharing options, not all shared links last indefinitely
- eager to see what surprises Daplie has, not sure what all the things he can do with it are
- wants to adopt Daplie for the long-term - does not want to switch systems shortly after owning Daplie, does not want to discover a superior product shortly after
