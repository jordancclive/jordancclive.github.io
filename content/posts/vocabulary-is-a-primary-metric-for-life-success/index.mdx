Disclaimer: saying that vocabulary is a primary metric for life "success" is in no way saying it *determines* it. There are no determining factors for success. And success is circumstantial, defined individually. However, success *can* be measured for any definition of it, and there *are* underlying causes in any example of success.

# The Strongest Corollary of Outstanding Success

After a century of <a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/17878/ctrstreadtechrepv01994i00605_opt.pdf">extensive research</a> on aptitudes, the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation has become known to be the world's leading aptitudes research institute. Their aptitude testing has been invaluable to me in my own journey of learning <a href="/the-best-aptitude-and-personal-strengths-tests">how to apply mine</a>. The founder <a href="https://www.jocrf.org/sites/jocrf.org/files/assets/Understanding_Your_Aptitudes.pdf">said</a> that command over vocabulary "accompanies outstanding success in [the United States] more often than any other single characteristic which… the Johnson O’Connor Research Foundation has been able to isolate and measure."

The most sited study by Johnson O'Connor conducted was extensively completed with the employees of 39 large manufacturing companies. Below are the results of a vocabulary test that have been averaged and grouped by the levels of their common corporate hierarchy. The relationship between employee's vocabulary and their position in the company demonstrates that better ability to think and commmunicate is closely tied to professional success.

There were no vocabulary tests administered in the hiring processes for the Foremen, Superintendents, Managers, Presidents and VPs. There were criteria more specific to the nature of their businesses and teams. Their vocabulary level was a natural correlary to their rise to the roles of highest responsibility and compensation. Their verbal command improved their ability to think, administer, and lead.

The findings on this may be surprising. That's because we do not emphasize the importance of reading and expanding our vocabulary enough.

<br />

## Verbal Command Matters More Than Inheritance

People usually equate success to wealth. Also, they often over-emphasize the relationship inheritance plays with it. The good majority of children of wealthy parents do not grow up to become wealthy as well. This phenomenon has been discovered in so many studies in so many ways. Search it. Or read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474" target="default">The Millionaire Next Door</a>. Money has incredible entropy. The difference between inheritance and increasing one's vocabulary, however, is significant, because one's ability to think is where personal success originates.

Building a love of learning, and by extension - strong cognition - among your children is more important than providing your children a rich upbringing.

<br />

# Why Vocabulary Is So Consequential

The reasons why command of vocabulary accompanies success so closely should not come as a surprise. Words are the very building blocks of thought. Expanding your vocabulary enhances your thinking capacity, which benefits all areas of life. The same way mastery of a wider variety of tools opens possibilities exponentially for an engineer, mastery over the building blocks of thought enable us to increase our level on consciousness, creativity, and leadership capabilities. We're able to build more out of ourselves as well as the conditions of our lives.

See the illustration here about how the results of increased vocabulary compounds.

We know this is true because this is the pattern we see in babies as they absorb words from their environment and then, over time, utilize them. The difference between babies and most children and adults is that we lose our eagerness to learn.

# Strategies for Expanding Your Vocabulary

### 1. Read voraciously.

The most articulate among as are the most voracious readers. Nothing builds one's rhetoric better than absorbing quality writing. (Actually writing, one's self, is the close second.) While you read, you're increasing your mastery of words you already know as well as learning new ones. Watching videos can easily devolve into passive observance and mental conditioning - mindlessly accepting ideas presented to you at face value. Reading is more active. You can move at your own pace, make sense of the words, and think through the ideas presented more deliberately.

<br />

### 2. Look up words habitually.

Referencing new words in a dictionary during the course of your reading is the best way to learn new vocabulary. This is because whatever topic you were reading about either created a new neural pathway or strengthened an existing one that you can attach that new word to.

<br />

### 3. Practice the new words you learn.

Neural networks are the wiring of cognition. They evolve around the thoughts that we reinforce. New words will be forgotten if left alone. It feels most natural to learn the words most relevant to our interests, but a discplined approach to practicing words is effective as well. Practicing the use of new words reinforces the neural pathways surrounding them and retains them in memory.

<br />

### 4. Memorize new words.

This is the most direct way of building your vocabulary. This approach does not, however, give new words the personal relevance that running into them within the flow of exploring an interest does. It is true, though, that after learning new words the universe seems to have a way of presenting them again to you. This is just because you'd notice it in a way you otherwise would not. My favorite method of memorizing new words is the mobile app for <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/" target="default">Vocabulary.com</a>.
