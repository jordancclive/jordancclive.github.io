The company for which I was Chief Product Officer was acquired. Last May I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jordancclive/posts/10155562823938034" target="default">made the decision</a> to take my career a different direction and Bryson filled in for me. The Daplie product remains today essentially how Bryson and I had left it.
