There are three forms of mentorship engagements I have with people:
1. Mentorship
2. Apprenticeships
3. Mentorship & part-time senior design augmentation for your team

Message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanclive/" target="default">LinkedIn</a> to schedule a get to know you call to discuss the possibility of any one of these three types of engagements.

<br />

## Design Mentorship
At any given time I am mentoring a dozen students - have been since September, 2020 - and **am always optimizing my process to achieve the best career outcomes for my students possible**. I personally invest my time, attention, and network in my students. **My one requirement is commitment to a routine.** See my <a href="/careerfoundry">CareerFoundry case study</a> about how I have continually improved my student learning outcomes. Whether you're looking to break into a product or UX career or level up your existing one, you have a couple options to consider for engaging with me:
- **CareerFoundry**: If you feel the need for a self-directed, self-paced, and well-structured curriculum, consider being a CareerFoundry student under my mentorship. To have me as your mentor in your CareerFoundry course, you have to sign up through <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/referral_registrations/new?referral=p732ZQEY" target="default">my referral link</a>. Otherwise, I will not be able to accommodate you in my schedule.
- **<a href="https://superpeer.com/jordanclive" target="default">Superpeer</a>**: If you're sufficiently self-motivated to pursue a custom learning path and need dedicated mentorship, feel free to book a call with me and I'd be happy to help you chart that custom course that will make most sense for your goals. My expectation is that you'll maintain a weekly call.

## Design / Design Thinking Apprenticeship
If you need any of the following, we can plan a design apprenticeship that is most beneficial to you:
- Stronger human factors mastery
- Stronger design fundamentals mastery
- Design facilitation know-how
- UI design experience

**<a href="https://www.innovator.studio" target="default">Innovator.Studio</a>** is my side project. It is a resource to help innovators and designers of any context hone their craft and build their technique. It's a heavy content lift. If you are trying to address a gap in where you are today and where you need to be to accomplish your career goals, I can carve out a piece of this project to collaborate with you on. In the end, **I will help you package your work into a case study article included in our contributions section.** You can share this article featuring your contributions and learning outcomes to your portfolio or resume as a demonstration of the skills you could bring to any project.

I can commit to an unpaid weekly call with you on the <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/jordan-clive" target="default">ADPList</a> platform so long as you are delivering on our apprenticeship plan.

## Mentorship & Part-time Senior Design Augmentation
On multiple occasions, my design students' companies have hired me to help them level up their deliverables and fill a senior-level vacancy on their teams. This is what is included in these engagements:
1. **Weekly routine mentorship call**: these are done over the <a href="https://superpeer.com/jordanclive" target="default">Superpeer</a> platform and can be entirely hands-on. I can I work with the designer in their Figma (or Sketch or Adobe XD) file. They usually shadow me as I unblock them in their tasks.
2. **Minimum of 10 hrs/ month of work outside of mentorship calls**: this is to ensure that I get the deeper insights necessary to deliver maximal impact.

This how I charge for these engagements:
- Monthly retainer accounting for 14 hours of work (weekly calls + 10 hrs of work)
- Hourly-rate applied to all hours worked over those accounted for in the monthly retainer
