If you are going to study UX design, consider doing so as a CareerFoundry student under my mentorship. See my <a href="/careerfoundry">CareerFoundry case study</a> about how I have continually improved my student learning outcomes.

To have me as your mentor in your CareerFoundry course, you have to sign up through <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/referral_registrations/new?referral=p732ZQEY" target="default">my referral link</a>. Otherwise, I will not be able to accommodate you in my schedule. Feel free to message me first on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanclive/">LinkedIn</a> to chat a bit about it and I will promptly set it up with CareerFoundry if you decide to move forward with it.
