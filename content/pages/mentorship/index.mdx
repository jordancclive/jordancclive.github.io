Since September, 2020, I have very much enjoyed mentoring UX, UI, and product designers in my off hours. If you are going to dive into this world, consider doing so as a CareerFoundry student under my mentorship. To learn of my approach, see my <a href="/careerfoundry">CareerFoundry case study</a> and my article series parts <a href="/statistical-process-control-applied-to-design-mentorship-part-1">1</a> and <a href="/statistical-process-control-applied-to-design-mentorship-part-2">2</a> about how I have continually improved my student learning outcomes.

To have me as your mentor in your CareerFoundry course, sign up through <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/referral_registrations/new?referral=p732ZQEY" target="default">my referral link</a> - at no extra charge to you - and I will make myself available for you. Otherwise, I will probably not be able to accommodate you in my schedule. My referral link:

<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/referral_registrations/new?referral=p732ZQEY" target="default">https://careerfoundry.com/en/referral_registrations/new?referral=p732ZQEY</a>

Or you could message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanclive/">LinkedIn</a> to chat a bit about it and I will promptly set it up with CareerFoundry if you decide to move forward with it.
