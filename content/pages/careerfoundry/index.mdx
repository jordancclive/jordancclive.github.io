#### Over *250* Hour-Long Mentorship Calls With UX Students

From September, 2020 to May, 2021 in my off hours I had conducted 195 hour-long mentorship calls and 56 hour-long, in-depth portfolio evaluations.

<br />

## Context

CareerFoundry offers a self-paced UX design course designed to take a full-time student 6 months to complete, or a part-time student 10 months. It includes the following seven sections:

1. **Intro to UX**: short design exercises surrounding most topics listed below
2. **Thinking Like a UXer**: history of UX, human factors, user-centered design, design thinking, UX research, competitive analysis, agile, etc.
3. **Understanding the User**: research methods, surveys, interviews, personas, mental models, user journeys, task analysis, user flows, content auditing, etc.
4. **Foundational Design**: information architecture principles and frameworks, card sorting, navigation design, UI design patterns, heuristics, (paper, rapid, mid-fi) prototyping, etc.
5. **Usability Testing**: usability testing methods, test planning and conducting, reporting and evaluation methods, A/B testing, etc.
6. **Refining the Design**: visual design principles, emotional design, responsive frameworks, front-end technology basics, design language systems, deliverables, and collaboration techniques
7. **End-to-End Design**: accessibility, polishing designs, career growth, etc.

<br />

#### Possible Routes for Graduating Students

Depending on a student's background, strengths, interests, and local job market, my students can aim for a variety of UX roles coming out of the course:

- UX Designer
- UI Designer
- UX Researcher
- Product Designer
- UX Writer
- Rapid Prototyper
- Instructional Designer
- Content Strategist

<br />

#### My Students Collectively Demand a Breadth of UX Expertise

I enjoy mentoring UX students in my off hours because setting up each student to get hired in the UX role that make most sense for them, individually, demands a breadth of UX expertise.

Within weeks of starting the course, my students are able to complete low fidelity prototypes like this:

Over the months we do copy work like this:

By end of the program, my students are able to produce work like this:
