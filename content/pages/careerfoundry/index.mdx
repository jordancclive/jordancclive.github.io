## Context

My CareerFoundry students come from a wide array of professional roles (teaching, graphic design, dance, customer service, marketing, etc) and experience levels (0 - 30 years). About half are making a career switch and half are starting out their careers.

Depending on a student's background, strengths, interests, and home city, they could shoot for a variety of UX roles coming out of the course:
- UX Designer
- UI Designer
- UX Researcher
- Product Designer
- UX Writer
- Rapid Prototyper
- Instructional Designer
- Content Strategist

I enjoy mentoring UX students in my off hours because it requires a different approach for each one of them.

**Data visualizations about who my students are**

They also have very different natural strengths and gravitate toward different aspects of design. All of them require a personalized approach - that is why  The curriculum covers the bread and butter elements and techniques of user experience design, but setting up each individual student to succeed in their job searches requires guidance during their process of self discovery.

#### Course Overview

This self-paced course is designed to take a full-time student 6 months to complete, or a part-time student 10 months. It includes the following seven sections:

1. **Intro to UX**: short design exercises surrounding most topics listed below
2. **Thinking Like a UXer**: history of UX, human factors, user-centered design, design thinking, UX research, competitive analysis, agile, etc.
3. **Understanding the User**: research methods, surveys, interviews, personas, mental models, user journeys, task analysis, user flows, content auditing, etc.
4. **Foundational Design**: information architecture principles and frameworks, card sorting, navigation design, UI design patterns, heuristics, (paper, rapid, mid-fi) prototyping, etc.
5. **Usability Testing**: usability testing methods, test planning and conducting, reporting and evaluation methods, A/B testing, etc.
6. **Refining the Design**: visual design principles, emotional design, responsive frameworks, front-end technology basics, design language systems, deliverables, and collaboration techniques
7. **End-to-End Design**: accessibility, polishing designs, career growth, etc.

Each section entails 10 or so assignment submissions and ends in a portfolio submission.

#### Role of the Mentor

Mentors evaluate the portfolio submissions and lead one-hour mentorship calls with students when they book them.

Usually within a month or so, my students are able to complete low fidelity prototypes like this:

Then over the months afterward, I help leveling up their UI capabilities through guided copy work like this:

By end of the program, they're able to design high fidelity UI designs like this:

## Desired Outcome for My Students

Make each student as marketable as possible in whatever route makes most sense for them. My two main levers of control over this outcome are:
1. Time spent with them over calls and
2. Improving my system of collectively assisting my students
