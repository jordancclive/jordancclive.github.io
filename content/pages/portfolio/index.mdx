I am a design and product leader with extensive startup experience and one <a href="https://news.clear.co.com/clearfoundation-acquires-daplie/" target="default">acquired product</a>.

Employing a variety of techniques, I go deep into business and user contexts, pull out signals from noise, map out complexity, design information environments and user interactions, and contribute to the user interface design of relevant, modern products and systems.
