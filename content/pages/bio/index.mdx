I am a designer with an orientation toward innovation and growth. I go deep into the product, design, research, data, and operations of a product team and move the needle through product design and information architecture.

In my private life I enjoy life with my wife, raising and homeschooling young ones. I've lived in nine states and have lived half my life outside the US in eight countries. We're now based in the least-spoken about state of the US, Arkansas, in the best-kept-secret town of Bentonville which has achieved "capital of the world" status for two criteria: retail business and mountain biking. We're active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where I currently serve as a Temple and Family History Consultant.
