Gamification draws from the external motivators of games - visually stimulating, external rewards. In practice, this means spending hours on making stuff for primary and bribing the kids to do what you want them to do. They have the appearance of games, but they\\u2019re not games and even a kid can quickly see through it. Game-based learning draws from the substance of games - what makes games actually engaging. In practice, you spend much less time preparing for primary, you keep the kids\\u2019 attention more effectively, and it\\u2019s no longer about the prize or candy but about the songs. A straight-forward example of this is tic tac toe for junior primary - a kid from one team draws an X on the board after a song, a kid from the opposing team draws an O after the next song. This grabs their attention the \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"whole time\"), \" and requires zero preparation. This is way better - for the kids and for you - than spending 45 minutes on a craft whose sole purpose is visual stimulation. (Tic tac toe is not a gold standard activity, I'm just illustrating a point.) Another universal example throughout the church is the picture matching game. It\\u2019s great for incorporating Church visuals, can be used for any sharing time topic, and keeps both junior and senior primary\\u2019s attention the whole sharing time. Games other than Matching that you can cycle through on occasion are Mad Gab (for song titles), a simple board game with a die and you see which team makes it to the end first, Sing or Dare, jeopardy...
