Claudius has murdered Hamlet\\u2019s father, his own brother, in order to usurp the throne of Denmark and to marry Hamlet\\u2019s widowed mother. Sunk into a state of despair, Hamlet is torn between his grief over his father\\u2019s death and his desire for revenge. 'Hamlet' is a work of great complexity and as such has drawn many different critical interpretations. Hamlet has been seen as a victim of circumstance, as an impractical idealist, as an opportunist, as the sufferer of a great melancholy, and as a man blinded by his own desire for revenge. Through the great deliberation with which Hamlet ponders his revenge, Shakespeare brilliantly dramatizes the complex philosophical and ethical issues that are at stake with such a violent action.

Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.

Walden, is an account of his stay in the woods and his experience. Shedding the trivial ties that he felt bound much of humanity, he pursued truth in the quiet of nature. Thoreau believes that such an experience enables one to gain true enlightenment. Even as Thoreau disentangled himself from worldly matters, his musings were often disturbed by his social conscience.

It draws on and expands the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but with a more critical and polemical approach. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm \\\"beyond good and evil\\\" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.\\\" - \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1503250881/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1503250881&linkId=bfe7285e93dec5afb43704c1c091804b\"\n  }, \"Amazon\"), \"\\nOther synopses: \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_and_Evil\"\n  }, \"Wikipedia\"), \", \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/376767.Beyond_Good_and_Evil?from_search=true&qid=cjGVIzItHs&rank=4\"\n  }, \"GoodReads\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Appearing in TJEd.org's \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.tjed.org/resources/classics/\"\n  }, \"Classics\"), \" and Jordan Peterson's\\xA0\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\"\n  }, \"Literature / Philosophy Books List\"))), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1503251284/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1503251284&linkCode=as2&tag=flowoflearnin-20&linkId=96ae18fc76df89f80fa113494450cc3f\",\n    target: \"_blank\",\n    rel: \"noopener\"\n  }, mdx(\"img\", {\n    className: \"alignleft\",\n    src: \"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1503251284&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=flowoflearnin-20\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  })), mdx(\"img\", {\n    style: {\n      \"border\": \"none !important\",\n      \"margin\": \"0px !important\"\n    },\n    src: \"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=flowoflearnin-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1503251284\",\n    alt: \"\",\n    width: \"1\",\n    height: \"1\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  }), mdx(\"h3\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1503251284/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1503251284&linkId=7056be9d288b86eb598bcd54acdb8924\"\n  }, \"Black Beauty\"), \", Anna Sewell (\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JCE3DO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000JCE3DO&linkId=712a571cf775f04699a84f3dc9e26223\"\n  }, \"Audible\"), \")\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"United Kingdom, 1877\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\\"While forthrightly teaching animal welfare, \", \"[this story]\", \" also teaches how to treat people with kindness, sympathy, and respect.

A terrifying encounter with the escaped convict Abel Magwitch in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decrepit Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella at Satis House; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor - these form a series of events that change the orphaned Pip's life forever, and he eagerly abandons his humble station as an apprentice to blacksmith Joe Gargery, beginning a new life as a gentleman. Charles Dickens's haunting late novel depicts Pip's education and development through adversity as he discovers the true nature of his identity, and his 'great expectations'. This definitive version uses the text from the first published edition of 1861. It includes a map of Kent in the early nineteenth century, and appendices on Dickens's original ending and his working notes, giving readers an illuminating glimpse into the mind of a great novelist at work. \\\" - \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141439564/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0141439564&linkId=1d3f133ce2505dc1364eed697ef5cbd1\"\n  }, \"Amazon\"), \"\\nOther synopses: \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9dB9BZWDBU\"\n  }, \"The School of Life\"), \", \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/greatex/summary/\"\n  }, \"SparkNotes\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Appearing in Bokklubben World Library's \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokklubben_World_Library\"\n  }, \"100 Best Books of All Time\"), \" and TJEd.org's \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.tjed.org/resources/classics/\"\n  }, \"Classics\"))), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691173222/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0691173222&linkCode=as2&tag=flowoflearnin-20&linkId=4116b387e0919fbeb63550d9a5c3ab2c\",\n    target: \"_blank\",\n    rel: \"noopener\"\n  }, mdx(\"img\", {\n    className: \"alignleft\",\n    src: \"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0691173222&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=flowoflearnin-20\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  })), mdx(\"img\", {\n    style: {\n      \"border\": \"none !important\",\n      \"margin\": \"0px !important\"\n    },\n    src: \"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=flowoflearnin-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0691173222\",\n    alt: \"\",\n    width: \"1\",\n    height: \"1\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  }), mdx(\"h3\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691173222/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0691173222&linkId=ad9f6c8f5b34565253c130d65fd954df\"\n  }, \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\"), \", Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm (\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R6IRFG6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00R6IRFG6&linkId=b7a0994e583502c683ff9350aba9bdba\"\n  }, \"Audible\"), \")\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Germany, 1812\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\\"\", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Grimms' Fairy Tales...\"), \"\\xA0is a collection of\\xA0fairy tales\\xA0by the\\xA0Grimm brothers or \\\"Brothers Grimm\\\"\\xA0- \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales\"\n  }, \"Wikipedia\"), \"\\n\\\"When Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm published their \\\"Children's and Household Tales\\\" in 1812, followed by a second volume in 1815, they had no idea that such stories as \\\"Rapunzel,\\\" \\\"Hansel and Gretel,\\\" and \\\"Cinderella\\\" would become the most celebrated in the world.\\\" -\\xA0 \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691173222/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0691173222&linkId=ad9f6c8f5b34565253c130d65fd954df\"\n  }, \"Amazon\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Appearing in Wikipedia's \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books\"\n  }, \"Best-Selling Books\"), \" and TJEd.org's \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.tjed.org/resources/classics/\"\n  }, \"Classics\"))), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784871516/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1784871516&linkCode=as2&tag=flowoflearnin-20&linkId=b1c40d0470ef84563b6145615ba53ba3\",\n    target: \"_blank\",\n    rel: \"noopener\"\n  }, mdx(\"img\", {\n    className: \"alignleft\",\n    src: \"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1784871516&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=flowoflearnin-20\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  })), mdx(\"img\", {\n    style: {\n      \"border\": \"none !important\",\n      \"margin\": \"0px !important\"\n    },\n    src: \"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=flowoflearnin-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1784871516\",\n    alt: \"\",\n    width: \"1\",\n    height: \"1\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  }), mdx(\"h3\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784871516/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1784871516&linkId=00644c339069888f1c13c6b329bd3ebd\"\n  }, \"The Gulag Archipelago\"), \", Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Soviet Union, 1973\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\\"Drawing on his own incarceration and exile, as well as on evidence from more than 200 fellow prisoners and Soviet archives, Aleksandr I.

The direct and unadorned narrative describes four remarkable journies of ship's surgeon Lemuel Gulliver, among them, one to the land of Lilliput, where six-inch-high inhabitants bicker over trivialities; and another to Brobdingnag, a land where giants reduce man to insignificance.

For adults, it is a witty parody of political life in Swift's time and a scathing send-up of manners and morals in 18th-century England.\\\" - \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486292738/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0486292738&linkId=c9919bfa204d660462d7733d75c8bbf4\"\n  }, \"Amazon\"), \"\\nOther synopses: \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gulliver/\"\n  }, \"SparkNotes\"), \", \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)\"\n  }, \"Wikipedia\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Appearing in\\xA0Bokklubben World Library's \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokklubben_World_Library\"\n  }, \"100 Best Books of All Time\"), \" and TJEd.org's \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.tjed.org/resources/classics/\"\n  }, \"Classics\"))), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1508480567/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1508480567&linkCode=as2&tag=flowoflearnin-20&linkId=66093eae686e806e6d36622690a537f9\",\n    target: \"_blank\",\n    rel: \"noopener\"\n  }, mdx(\"img\", {\n    className: \"alignleft\",\n    src: \"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1508480567&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=flowoflearnin-20\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  })), mdx(\"img\", {\n    style: {\n      \"border\": \"none !important\",\n      \"margin\": \"0px !important\"\n    },\n    src: \"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=flowoflearnin-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1508480567\",\n    alt: \"\",\n    width: \"1\",\n    height: \"1\",\n    border: \"0\"\n  }), mdx(\"h3\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1508480567/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1508480567&linkId=0f284f91bdb31f72db7d0d4fcb136007\"\n  }, \"Heidi\"), \", Johanna Spyri (\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078K35YMJ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=flowoflearnin-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078K35YMJ&linkId=1e1cbc60d5c963910943c93c64c2af35\"\n  }, \"Audible\"), \")\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Switzerland, 1880\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\\"Little orphan Heidi goes to live high in the Alps with her gruff grandfather and brings happiness to all who know her on the mountain.

Inspired by the \\\"gusts of memory\\\" that rise up within him as he dips a Madeleine into hot tea, the narrator discusses his fear of going to bed at night. He is a creature of habit and dislikes waking up in the middle of the night not knowing where he is. He claims that people are defined by the objects that surround them and must piece together their identities bit by bit each time they wake up. The young Marcel is so nervous about sleeping alone that he looks forward to his mother's goodnight kisses, but also dreads them as a sign of an impending sleepless night. One night, when Charles Swann, a friend of his grandparents, is visiting, his mother cannot come kiss him goodnight.
