The band's core never changed, though. Joe and I were in it 'til the end. I think the question of whether I was an insane control freak or whether I was right to take the music more seriously than anyone else is ultimately best answered by the listener's judgement of the quality of the music. If you think the EP below is good for a high school band then I guess it means I had some merit to my approach. If not, then well...
