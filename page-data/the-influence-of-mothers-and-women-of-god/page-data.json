On my dad's side everyone also had at least a couple same-age cousins and we saw each other about once every three years for a family reunion. They were great and we had special relationships on that side, but when you got together there was always this \", \"[need to]\", \" get caught up first. It was that kind of relationship. How is it that two families that are so comparable would have that kind of a difference? In thinking about it, it becomes more clear that my mom had two other sisters.

In Lord of the Flies you explore a thought experiment of sorts about what would happen if on a remote island there were only boys without the civilizing influence of adults, especially women.
